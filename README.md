# rootChineseTablets
Script for rooting mtk based tablets

Chinese tablets are difficult to root some time OEM manufactorers do not provide suffiecient help. Recently I have hacked and exploited root file system. 

My goal is to silently install another android apk with out any user intervention. I have written my OTA client and apk file is kept in our server. This way I can isntall android application with informing user.

I have tested this hack on mtk based android 5.1 tablets without flashing Custom Rom or modifying build.prop and default.prop files.
