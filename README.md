# rootChineseTablets

Chinese tablets are difficult to root some time OEM manufactorers do not provide sufficient help. Recently I have hacked and exploited android root file system. 

My goal is to silently install another android application with out any user intervention. I have written my OTA client and apk file is kept in our server. This way I can install android application without informing user.

I have tested this hack on mtk based android 5.1 tablets without flashing Custom Rom or modifying build.prop and default.prop files.
